# GNS3_network_working
The work I have done in the GNS3 environment has been shared openly with its files for everyone to benefit from.

#DHCP Scenario: By filtering the interfaces defined on the VLAN, the DHCP server was tested to work successfully and configurations were added to the devices.

#It has been designed to test the scenario called #EIGRP on an advanced network and the relevant files have been uploaded.

How #Radius/Tacacs+ AAA Protocols work and are configured was examined, and as a result, the status of the ports was tested in the Kali Linux environment.
