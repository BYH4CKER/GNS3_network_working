# GNS3_network_working
The work I have done in the GNS3 environment has been shared openly with its files for everyone to benefit from.

#DHCP Scenario: By filtering the interfaces defined on the VLAN, the DHCP server was tested to work successfully and configurations were added to the devices.

#It has been designed to test the scenario called #EIGRP on an advanced network and the relevant files have been uploaded.

#A study was conducted on GLBP, which is the #Backup Route Protocol.

How #Radius/Tacacs+ AAA Protocols work and are configured was examined, and as a result, the status of the ports was tested in the Kali Linux environment.

#A lab study on the #VRRP Protocol, how it works and the configurations can be opened and read directly with the GNS3 extension mentioned by name in the attachment.

##Tacacs+ It was tried to actually test the protocol, try it on the R1 router and take the inputs from another place and verify from there.

#In the #Pentestv1 project, it is an example topology design designed to test how to infiltrate network devices and take the necessary precautions.

# It is a study we did in the computer systems laboratory course at the university and is designed to write and test simple operations such as DHCP server detection and SNMP query on the network in Python.
#Protocols such as #OSPF and HSRP were used.

#A topology that I have examined has been designed, configured and tested in order to move it securely to another place over the #IPSEC network at the Network layer level.
